# Distribution-of-Cadbury
TechGig problem - distribute cadburies among children in a queue


Objective : You have to caluclate the number of children which can be given perfect square chocolates 
            from given length and breadth of rectangle of chocolates.
            
            Length and breadth of rectangles would be provided as input.
            
            
 Input :-   4 Integers will be provieded as input 
 
		Test Input :  5 6 3 4 
		First 2 integers are given length of possible rectangles that can be formed
    Next 2 integers are given breadth of possible rectangles 
      	
 		Possible rectangles that can be formed from input : --     5 x 3 ,  5x4,   6 x3, 6x4 
    
		
		You have to find out maximum perfect squares that can be formed from these rectangular chocolates.
    
    
		Example : -  
        (i)   For :  5 x3 rectangle   Possible perfect squares would be : - 3x3 
											    2x2
											    1x1
											    1x1
	`			(ii) So, Chocolates can be given to FOUR children
              For :  5 x4 rectangle   Possible perfect squares would be :-    4x4  
                                                                              1x1
                                                                              1x1
                                                                              1x1
                                                                              1x1
	`			(iii) So, Chocolates can be given to FIVE children
  
			      For :  6 x3 rectangle   Possible perfect squares would be :-      3x3 
											   	                                                    3x3
				    So, Chocolates can be given to TWO children
           
         (iv) So, Chocolates can be given to FIVE children
  
			      For :  6 x4 rectangle   Possible perfect squares would be :-      4x4 
											   	                                                    2x2
                                                                              2x2
				    So, Chocolates can be given to THREE children
            
            
            Addition of all these 4 cases OUTPUT should be : 4 + 5 + 2+ 3 = 14 
            
            
            OUTPUT should be 14. As 14 children can be given perfect square chocoloates from given set of possible rectangles.
